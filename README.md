# 啟動 github page 方式

1.先在 github 建立儲存庫
2.建立好之後複製 …or push an existing repository from the command line 裡面三段程式碼
git remote add origin https://github.com/danlin2019/cra-sample.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

3.將東西push上去
4.接下來需要在 package.json 加上   "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app",
規則  "homepage": "https://你的git名稱.github.io/儲存庫"
5. 安裝 npm install --save gh-pages
6.在 "scripts": 裡加上
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
7 在分支那邊下拉 找到 gh-pages 點進去
8.選擇右上角 Settings 找到右側的 Pages
9.右側會顯示你的網址 Your site is live at https://danlin2019.github.io/cra-sample/ ，如果沒有顯示 請重整
10.按下 visit site 即可到達你的 github page

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
